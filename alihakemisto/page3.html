		<h1>The micro Text editor</h1>
		<div id="micro">
			<p class="napsu">First impressions using the micro text editor are 
			really good,micro uses a lot of the more 
			modern keybinds like ctrl+c ctrl+v. It is really easy to get the hang of the program. I watched a quick 15 minute
			video on youtube about the basics of micro and I'm already used to most of the easy keybinds.
			</p>
			<p class="napsu">One thing I dont like is the way you edit text. If you go to edit a word in the middle of a sentece it
			automatically writes ontop of the already written text. I'm sure there is a way to tweak the settings 
			for that to not happen, but I'm too lazy to do reserach on that since I've already got the gist of the 
			program down.

			<p class="txt">This text editor is really simple to pick up and beginner friendly, it has most of the useful tools
			that <a href="page1.html">Emacs</a> and <a href="page2.html">vim </a>have. </p>
		</div>
			
		<div id="second">
			<p class="txt">Obviously it lacks the customizability and documentation that something like <a href="page1.html">Emacs</a> has.
			It is significantly harder to find solutions to problems online for this text editor compared to 
			the first two. Simply for editing text I think this is the fastest to use. 
			
		</div>
		<div id="third">
			<p class="txt">Some cool features I like about this editor is that I can use my mouse to move from one point to
			another. <a href="page1.html">Emacs</a> and <a href="page2.html">vim </a> didn't have that feature. This really speeds up my work. Having to only use hotkeys
			or the arrowkeys for moving is somewhat limiting and at some points frustrating.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="seppo">
			<p id="asdtxt"> I think this might be my favourite text editor simply because of its ease of use. Editing code in this
			is pretty easy and the syntax highlighting is really similar to visual studio code. I see myself using this
			for editing multiple text files in the future. I think <a href="page1.html">Emacs</a> is my second favourite editor, <a href="page2.html">vim </a> being my 
			third favourite. It could be the other way around with <a href="page2.html">vim </a> and <a href="page1.html">Emacs</a> due to me strating this assignment
			with <a href="page1.html">Emacs</a> and getting used to the shortcuts and keybinds. Micro is definitely my favourite despite using
			this editor last.
