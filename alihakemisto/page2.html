		<p id="yeah">I tried using the <a href="page2.html">vim<a/> text editor for making this page and I have to say; The <a href="page2.html">vim<a/> text editor has way better visual highlighting for the syntax than <a href="page1.html">Emacs<a/> obiously <a href="page1.html">Emacs<a/> is probably way more customizable than <a href="page2.html">vim<a/>, but the default settings just seem to be better for a laymans eyes.</p>

			<p id="savetxt"> I personally dont enjoy having to always esc :w to save my work, it slows down my pace and throws my workflow off. Having to exit the insert mode and save that way is frustrating.</p>
			<p id="gttxt"> Switching between the files isn't as great as Emacs either and I couldn't figure out how to get my css and html files to split horizontally.</p>

		<p id="plugtxt"> The emmet plugin is a great tool for html, I love the fact that there is an easy way to get the simple html frame into the program quickly with only a few button presses.</p>

			<p id="closing">I think <a href="page2.thml">vim<a/> is an ok text editor, but some of the features just feel really clunky.The copy and paste didn't work for me for some reason and I just gave up trying to use it after a few tries. Also the different modes and getting used to all the differing keybinds in said modes is a little too overwhelming for a beginner like me. I personally see myself using <a href="page1.html">Emacs<a/> and <a href="page3.html">Micro<a/> more than vim.</p>
